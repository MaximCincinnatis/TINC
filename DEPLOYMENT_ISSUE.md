# Deployment Issue Analysis

## Problem
The realistic sea creatures are built and committed to the repository, but the main domain `tinc-burn-tracker.vercel.app` is not showing the latest deployment.

## Current Status
- ✅ **Code is correct**: Realistic sea creatures are in the source code
- ✅ **Build is correct**: Latest build contains the realistic SVG icons
- ✅ **Git is working**: Repository is public and connected to Vercel
- ✅ **Deployment is successful**: Latest deployment shows READY status
- ❌ **Domain mapping issue**: Main domain not pointing to latest deployment

## Evidence
1. **Latest deployment**: `tinc-burn-tracker-5tou620rv-maxims-projects-598f131a.vercel.app` (READY)
2. **Main domain**: `tinc-burn-tracker.vercel.app` (not updated)
3. **API permission issues**: 403 errors when trying to manage domain aliases

## Solutions

### Option 1: Vercel CLI (Recommended)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy to production
vercel --prod

# This will ensure the main domain gets the latest deployment
```

### Option 2: Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find the `tinc-burn-tracker` project
3. Go to the latest deployment
4. Click "Visit" to see if it has the sea creatures
5. If it does, click "Promote to Production"

### Option 3: Re-link Repository
1. Go to Vercel project settings
2. Disconnect the GitHub repository
3. Reconnect it
4. This should trigger a fresh deployment

## Verification
The realistic sea creatures are confirmed to be in the code:
- **Poseidon**: Detailed trident with `viewBox="0 0 100 100"`
- **Whale**: Realistic body with fins and tail
- **Shark**: Streamlined design with dorsal fin
- **Dolphin**: Curved body with beak
- **Squid**: Elongated body with tentacles
- **Shrimp**: Segmented body with antennae

## Next Steps
Use the Vercel CLI to deploy directly and ensure the main domain gets updated.
