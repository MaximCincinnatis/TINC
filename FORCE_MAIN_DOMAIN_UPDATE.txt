FORCE MAIN DOMAIN UPDATE - FRESH DATA
=====================================

Timestamp: 2025-07-15T20:40:00Z
Purpose: Force main Vercel domain to update with fresh blockchain data

LATEST CHANGES THAT SHOULD BE LIVE:
- Total Supply: 14,199,797.252 TINC (up from 14,164,527)
- Total Burned: 726,897.258 TINC (up from 723,482)  
- Total Addresses: 981 (corrected from 982)
- Poseidon Holders: 1 (corrected from 2)
- Whale Holders: 8
- LP positions excluded from counts

CRITICAL UPDATE:
The main domain https://tinc-burn-tracker.vercel.app/ must show:
- 1 Poseidon holder (not 2)
- 981 total addresses (not 982)
- Fresh burn data through July 15, 2025

If this doesn't update the main domain, there may be a caching issue or the domain needs manual refresh in Vercel dashboard.
