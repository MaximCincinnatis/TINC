# How to Enable Auto-Deployment for Private Repository

## Problem
The GitHub repository `MaximCincinnatis/TINC` is private, which is why Vercel's auto-deployment isn't working automatically.

## Solution Options

### Option 1: Make Repository Public (Recommended)
1. Go to https://github.com/MaximCincinnatis/TINC
2. Click **Settings** tab
3. Scroll down to **Danger Zone**
4. Click **Change repository visibility**
5. Select **Make public**
6. Confirm the change

Once public, Vercel will automatically deploy from Git pushes.

### Option 2: Configure Vercel for Private Repository
1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Find your `tinc-burn-tracker` project
3. Click **Settings** → **Git**
4. Make sure you're connected to the correct GitHub account
5. Ensure the Vercel GitHub App has access to private repositories
6. Re-link the repository if needed

### Option 3: Use Vercel CLI (Manual but Reliable)
```bash
# Install Vercel CLI globally
npm install -g vercel

# Login to Vercel
vercel login

# Deploy from project directory
vercel --prod
```

### Option 4: Deploy Hook (Current Working Solution)
I can create a deploy hook that you can trigger manually when needed.

## Current Status
- ✅ Realistic sea creatures are implemented in the code
- ✅ Build contains all the sea creature silhouettes
- ✅ Code is pushed to GitHub
- ❌ Auto-deployment is blocked by private repository

## Verification
The realistic sea creatures are confirmed to be in the build:
- All 6 classifications (Poseidon, Whale, Shark, Dolphin, Squid, Shrimp)
- Single-color but anatomically accurate SVG silhouettes
- Detailed design as requested

## Next Steps
Choose one of the options above to enable deployment. Option 1 (making the repository public) is the simplest and will enable automatic deployment from Git pushes.
