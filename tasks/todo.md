# TINC Burn Tracker Dashboard - Task List

## Project Overview
Creating a React-based web dashboard to track TINC token burns over the last 30 days, running on localhost:3006 (port 6000 was conflicting).

## Current Issues to Fix
The user reported:
1. Page only shows 1 bar on July 13 despite 164 transactions
2. App takes long time to load - needs world-class loading UI
3. Need to pull in TINC logo from https://titanfarms.win/
4. Need to audit how we're pulling and displaying data

## Todo Items

### Immediate Fixes (High Priority)
- [ ] Fix data aggregation issue - showing only 1 bar when there are 164 transactions
  - [ ] Debug why burnService.ts is not properly aggregating daily burns
  - [ ] Verify block timestamp fetching is working correctly
  - [ ] Ensure all burns are being counted in daily totals
- [ ] Complete LoadingProgress integration in App.tsx
  - [ ] Wire up progress callbacks from burnService
  - [ ] Show loading overlay during data fetch
  - [ ] Display progress messages and percentage
- [ ] Add TINC logo from titanfarms.win
  - [ ] Fetch logo from website
  - [ ] Add to App header

### Data Validation
- [ ] Audit burn data fetching logic
  - [ ] Verify Transfer event filtering (to 0x0 address)
  - [ ] Check block range calculations
  - [ ] Validate timestamp conversions
- [ ] Test with specific July 13 data
  - [ ] Query all burns for that specific day
  - [ ] Verify aggregation logic

### UI Improvements
- [ ] Polish loading UI
  - [ ] Add smooth transitions
  - [ ] Show detailed progress messages
  - [ ] Handle error states gracefully

### Testing
- [ ] Run comprehensive tests on data fetching
- [ ] Verify all daily burns show correctly
- [ ] Test both Quick and Full refresh modes
- [ ] Ensure caching works properly

- 12 RPC endpoints configured for reliability

## Current Status
- React app is running successfully on localhost:3006
