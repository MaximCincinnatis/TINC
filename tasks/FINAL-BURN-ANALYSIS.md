# Final Burn Analysis Report

## Executive Summary
After thorough investigation, I found that our burn tracking has **TWO separate issues**:

## Issue #1: Limited Block Range
- Script fetches 30 days of data based on block estimates
- Block estimation can be inaccurate, missing recent burns
- Current data: July 30 - Aug 28 (but gaps exist)

## Issue #2: Incorrect Initial Analysis
**I need to correct my earlier findings:**
- The "5 burn addresses" I identified were wrong
- UniversalBuyAndBurn, FarmKeeper, and PeggedFarmKeeper are NOT burn addresses
- They are contracts that RECEIVE tokens and then BURN them to 0x0

## Actual Burn Mechanism
1. Users/protocols send TINC → Contract addresses (UniversalBuyAndBurn, etc.)
2. Contracts burn TINC → 0x0 address
3. Our script correctly monitors burns to 0x0
4. We're capturing 99.5% of burns WITHIN our block range

## Real Problem
The script is working correctly for burns it sees, but:
- Block range calculation is off
- Missing recent blocks due to timing issues
- Possible RPC endpoint failures causing gaps

## Test Results
- **Within our block range**: 99.5% accuracy (202/203 burns captured)
- **Last 24 hours**: Script may miss recent burns if run timing is off
- **Missing burn**: Only 1 burn of 6713.75 TINC in block 23095006

## Conclusion
The burn mechanism is correctly implemented. The issue is with:
1. Block range calculation/estimation
2. Possible RPC timeouts causing missed chunks
3. Timing of when the script runs vs recent burns

## Recommendation
1. Don't change burn address monitoring (it's correct)
2. Fix block range calculation to ensure full coverage
3. Add retry logic for failed chunks
4. Run script more frequently to catch recent burns
