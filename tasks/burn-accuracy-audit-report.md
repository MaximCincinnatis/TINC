# TINC Burn Data Accuracy Audit Report
Date: 2025-08-09

## Executive Summary
**CRITICAL ISSUE FOUND**: The cached burn data in `burn-data.json` is significantly underreporting actual TINC burns. Our system is missing approximately **421,296 TINC** (54.4% of actual burns) over the last 7 days.

## Audit Methodology
1. Compared cached burn data from `data/burn-data.json` against live blockchain data
2. Queried Etherscan API for all TINC transfers to burn address (0x0000...0000) in last 7 days
3. Analyzed discrepancies between cached and on-chain data

## Key Findings

### Burn Data Comparison (Last 7 Days)

| Date       | Cached Burns | On-Chain Burns | Difference | Missing % |
|------------|-------------|----------------|------------|-----------|
| 2025-08-03 | 50,275 TINC (8 txs) | 77,158 TINC (34 txs) | -26,883 TINC | 34.8% missing |
| 2025-08-04 | 20,821 TINC (10 txs) | 60,097 TINC (41 txs) | -39,276 TINC | 65.3% missing |
| 2025-08-05 | 59,735 TINC (6 txs) | 170,494 TINC (22 txs) | -110,760 TINC | 65.0% missing |
| 2025-08-06 | 855 TINC (1 tx) | 6,644 TINC (4 txs) | -5,789 TINC | 87.1% missing |
| 2025-08-07 | 98,027 TINC (11 txs) | 178,880 TINC (40 txs) | -80,853 TINC | 45.2% missing |
| 2025-08-08 | 98,917 TINC (11 txs) | 157,558 TINC (37 txs) | -58,642 TINC | 37.2% missing |
| 2025-08-09 | 26,510 TINC (7 txs) | 125,705 TINC (31 txs) | -99,195 TINC | 78.9% missing |

### Total Discrepancy
- **Cached Total**: 355,139 TINC (54 transactions)
- **On-Chain Total**: 776,536 TINC (213 transactions)
- **Missing Burns**: 421,396 TINC (159 transactions)
- **Accuracy Rate**: 45.6% (we're capturing less than half of actual burns)

## Root Cause Analysis

### Transaction Count Mismatch
- Cached data shows 54 transactions over 7 days
- On-chain data shows 213 transactions
- We're missing 74.6% of burn transactions

### Possible Causes
1. **Incomplete Transfer Event Monitoring**: The system may only be tracking burns from specific addresses (like UniversalBuyAndBurn at 0x060e990...) and missing burns from other sources
2. **Block Range Issues**: The fetching script might not be scanning all relevant blocks
3. **RPC Limitations**: Rate limiting or timeouts may cause incomplete data fetches
4. **Filter Logic Error**: The event filter might be too restrictive

## Immediate Recommendations

1. **Fix Data Fetching Logic**
   - Review `scripts/fetch-burn-data.js` to ensure it captures ALL transfers to 0x0000...0000
   - Remove any address filtering that limits burns to specific source addresses
   - Verify block range calculations are correct

2. **Implement Data Validation**
   - Add automated verification against Etherscan after each update
   - Alert if discrepancy exceeds 1%
   - Log all skipped or failed transactions

3. **Historical Data Correction**
   - Re-fetch all burn data from contract deployment
   - Update cached data with accurate values
   - Implement checksum verification

4. **Add Monitoring**
   - Create daily reconciliation reports
   - Track fetch success rates
   - Monitor for missing transactions

## Impact Assessment
- Dashboard is showing approximately 45% of actual TINC burns
- Users are seeing incorrect deflationary metrics
- Total burned amount is underreported by over 400,000 TINC in just 7 days

## Next Steps
1. Immediately fix the burn fetching logic
2. Re-sync all historical burn data
3. Implement validation checks
4. Add monitoring and alerting for data accuracy

## Verification Script
Created `scripts/verify-burns.js` for ongoing accuracy checks. This script should be run daily to ensure data integrity.
