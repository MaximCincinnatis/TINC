## ‚ö†Ô∏è Potential Issues

### Minor Discrepancy on Aug 8-9
- **Aug 8**: One transaction (6,713.74 TINC) appears in backup but not current
- **Aug 9**: Test backup missing 6,919.43 TINC compared to others
- **Likely cause**: Transaction re-indexing or timestamp boundary issues

### Missing Historical Data
- Current system only maintains 30-day rolling window
- **July 11-16** data not available in any backup
- **July 17-27** only preserved in test-backup file

## Recommendations

1. **Aug 8-9 Discrepancy**: Re-fetch data for these specific dates to verify correct amounts
2. **Historical Preservation**: Consider maintaining monthly archives if historical data needed
3. **Data Validation**: The 87% consistency rate is good, but the Aug 8 discrepancy should be investigated

## Conclusion
**No significant burns are missing**. The minor discrepancies on Aug 8-9 (~6,700 TINC) represent less than 1% of the total burns for the period. The majority of data (87% of days) shows perfect consistency across all backups.
